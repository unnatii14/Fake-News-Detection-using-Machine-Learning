## 📖 Overview  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify news content as either fake or real. It uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on labeled news data, with **TF-IDF vectorization** for text processing. The model is deployed with **Gradio**, providing a clean and user-friendly web interface to test the system in real-time.


## 🚀 Features  
✅ Detects fake news using a trained **Logistic Regression** model  
✅ Utilizes **TF-IDF** vectorization for effective text feature extraction  
✅ Built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, and **Gradio**  
✅ Simple and interactive **web interface** via Gradio
